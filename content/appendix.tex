\hline
Microstructural constituents & Dependent on/characteristics \newline (selection) & Responsible for (examples) \\
\midrule
Vacancies & Temperature, deformation & Hardening at low temperatures; diffusion processes at elevated temperatures; diffusional creep \\
Dislocations & Deformation, temperature, recovery and recrystallization processes; at elevated temperatures edge dislocations may climb, and leave their slip planes & Plastic deformation strength is controlled by their number and motion; driving force for recrystallization; dislocation creep \\
Stacking faults & Crystal structure, alloying & Mobility of dislocations, for example, climb of edge dislocations and cross-slip of screw dislocations is hampered \\
Mechanical twins & Stacking fault energy, deformation, temperature & Additional deformation mechanism at low temperatures and/or high strain rates \\
Subgrains/domains & Deformation, temperature, stacking fault energy/ordered crystal structure; antiphase boundary energy & Work hardening, creep, creation of antiphase boundaries \\
Grain boundaries & Lattice orientation between neighboring grains; subdivision in small-angle, medium-angle and high-angle grain boundaries & Work hardening by acting as barries to slip from one grain to the next; segregation site of impurity atoms \\
Phase boundaries & Alloy system, composition, phase stability at elavated temperatures & Strengthening effects, for example, in duplex or multiphase steels\\
Grains & Alloy system, type of nucleation, processing, deformation, heat treatment, recrytallization & Strengthening (see grain boundaries) but ductility is maintained; grain boundary sliding at elavated temperatures (creep, superplasticity)\\
Annealing twins & Stacking fault energy; characteristic of face-cenntered cubic materials exhibiting a low stacking fault energy & Lowering of total boundary energy during grain growth \\
Precipitates/\newline dispersoids & Alloy system, composition, heat treatment, processing; the interface between particle and matrix can be coherent, semicoherent, or incoherent & Increase in strength by the interaction of moving dislocation; dislocations can loop, cut through or cross-slip the particles at ambient temperatures; at elevated temperatures the dislocations can surmount the particles by climb processes\\
