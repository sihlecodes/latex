\phantomchapter{Abstract}
Aqueous Film Forming Foam (\acrshort{afff}) has become a critical constituent within the aviation industry. It was declared by \Acrfull{nfpa} as a sole optimum extinguishing agent for suppression of hydrocarbon fires. Nevertheless, unexpected circumstances occur when \acrshort{afff} is unable to perform as anticipated. In the aviation industry, this is normally noticed during periodic tests. As a consequence, it has become a necessity to monitor the performance of \acrshort{afff} on a regular basis.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the storage facility on the performance parameters of \acrshort{afff}. The principal focus is on the materials that are commonly used to construct the storage tanks used for storing \acrshort{afff} concentrate, namely mild steel, stainless steel, and \acrfull{hdpe}. The aim focuses specifically on ascertaining if these materials affect the properties of \acrshort{afff} concentrate, thus influencing its performance during firefighting. In this way, it is uncomplicated to explore materials that are innocuous to \acrshort{afff} concentrate. Furthermore, the optimization of these materials in such a way that they are compatible with \acrshort{afff} concentrate becomes a feasible alternative.

A qualitative research approach was used to investigate the impact of the materials used to construct the storage tank for storing \acrshort{afff} concentrate. Based on the aforementioned challenges, \Acrfull{ftir}, \acrfull{tem}, dynamic light scattering, and \acrfull{icp-aes} were all used for testing the materials. The findings from the primary research concluded that the three materials affect the foaming ability and foam stability of the \acrshort{afff} solution, with the severity being the variance. \acrshort{hdpe} was found to have a less severe impact, while stainless steel had a tolerable impact. The findings demonstrated that mild steel greatly affects the aforementioned performance parameters of \acrshort{afff}. Based on these findings, it was concluded that mild steel is incompatible with \acrshort{afff} concentrate.
